# DevUtils
Welcome to DevUtils, a Unity asset package that offers a range of versatile and efficient tools designed to simplify and speed up your development workflow in Unity. This package aims to provide reusable solutions for common game development challenges and architectural needs, allowing you to focus more on creating your game logic and less on managing the underlying structure.

With DevUtils, you get a collection of robust utilities including:

1. `Singleton`: A generic implementation of the singleton pattern, allowing you to effortlessly instantiate and manage singleton objects in your game.

2. `MonoSingleton`: A singleton pattern built specifically for MonoBehaviour classes in Unity. It takes care of creating an instance on demand, managing the singleton lifecycle, and providing global access to the instance.

3. `OrderedList<T>`: A handy utility class for maintaining a list of elements with a specific order or priority. This is useful in scenarios like event management, task scheduling, and any situation where the order of elements matters.

4. `OrderedElement<T>`: A class encapsulating an element within an ordered collection and associates it with an ordering value. It's used in conjunction with `OrderedList<T>` to organize and manage ordered data.

And much more to come! The DevUtils package is an evolving suite of tools, with new utilities and features planned for future releases. It's not just a toolset, it's a growing ecosystem aimed at making your game development in Unity easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking for ways to streamline your process, or a beginner seeking to understand and apply best practices, DevUtils has something to offer you.

## Getting Started

To get started with DevUtils, simply download the package from the Unity Asset Store and import it into your project. To use any of the classes in DevUtils, you will need to import the namespace `KennethDevelops.DevUtils.Model` at the top of your script.

Once imported, the utilities are ready for use and can be accessed from your scripts. Check out the documentation for each utility for more detailed information, usage instructions, and examples.

Within the Package you have offline `documentation` (DevUtils \[version\].pdf) inside Plugins/DevUtils/Docs, but you can also look at the online documentation [here](https://github.com/kennethdevelops/DevUtilsDocs/wiki)

Stay tuned for updates, and happy game developing with DevUtils!
